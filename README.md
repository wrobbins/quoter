# Quoter

A simple CLI app in Rust to obtain stock quotes.

This is an exercise in getting _some_ exposure to [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## TODO

- [ ] replace reqwest with ureq
- [ ] accept 1-N sybols on the cli
- [ ] config file for saving default symbols
- [ ] pretty output options:
  - [colored](https://github.com/mackwic/colored)
  - [prettytable](https://github.com/phsym/prettytable-rs)
- [ ] optional configs for calculating cost basis
