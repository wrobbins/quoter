# Quoter

![build-status](https://github.com/wrobbins/quoter/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

A simple CLI app in Rust to obtain stock quotes.

This is an exercise in getting _some_ exposure to [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## TODO

- [x] replace reqwest with [ureq](https://github.com/algesten/ureq)
- [x] accept 1-N sybols on the cli
- [ ] config file for saving default symbols
- [ ] pretty output options:
